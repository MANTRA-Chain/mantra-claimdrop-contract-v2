# ShellCheck configuration for cast scripts
# https://www.shellcheck.net/

# Set shell dialect to bash
shell=bash

# Disable specific checks with rationale

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# Reason: We use dynamic sourcing with $SCRIPT_DIR which is legitimate
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file
# Reason: ShellCheck may not find files during CI or in different contexts
disable=SC1091

# SC2154: Variable is referenced but not assigned
# Reason: Many variables come from sourced .env file or deployments.txt
disable=SC2154

# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references
# Reason: While good practice, enforcing this everywhere is overly pedantic
# We use braces where necessary (ambiguity, special cases)
disable=SC2250

# SC2292: Prefer [[ ]] over [ ] for tests
# Reason: Both are valid; [ ] is more portable. We use [[ ]] for regex/advanced features
disable=SC2292

# SC2312: Consider invoking command separately to avoid masking return value
# Reason: Many intentional command chains (date formatting fallbacks)
disable=SC2312

# SC2248: Prefer double quoting even when variables don't contain special chars
# Reason: We quote where necessary; enforcing everywhere reduces readability
disable=SC2248

# SC2310: Function invoked in condition disables set -e
# Reason: This is intentional - we want to handle errors gracefully with || and if
disable=SC2310

# SC2153: Possible misspelling
# Reason: Variables like RPC_URL are set by environment/sourced files
disable=SC2153

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing
# Reason: Many arithmetic operations don't need quotes; enforcing everywhere is pedantic
disable=SC2086

# Enable all optional checks for maximum code quality
enable=all
